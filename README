Simple calculator

Compile by: make

Run by: ./simple_calculator <volintari textfile>

------------------------------------------------
When run the following commands is accepted:

    <register> <operation> <value>
    
    <register> <operation> <register>
    
    print <register>
    
    quit
-----------------------------------------------

Look at test1.text, test2.test, test3.test for  
examples on how a input textfile can look

The calculator dose lazy evaluation, aka evaluation at print 
for commands in the form of "<register> <operation> <register>".
This is done by when the command is run the string of the 
operation is saved and then evaluated when "print <register>"
is called. 

If more than one "<register> <operation> <register>"
is done on the same left <register>, the latest string of
the operations will be evaluated first
